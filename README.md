# Joomla Cypress
This is a support package that helps in writing end-to-end tests for the [Joomla CMS](https://joomla.org) and its extensions with the frontend testing tool [Cypress](/https://www.cypress.io/).

The Cypress API is extended with [custom commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands).

Joomla versions 4 and 5 are supported.
